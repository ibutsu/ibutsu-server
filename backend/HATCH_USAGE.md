# Hatch Usage Guide for ibutsu-server Backend

This document explains how to use Hatch for development and testing of the ibutsu-server backend.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ installed
- Hatch installed (`pip install hatch`)

## Available Environments

### Default Environment
The default environment uses Python 3.9 and includes basic dependencies for development:

```bash
# Create and activate the default environment
hatch shell

# Run tests
hatch run test

# Run tests with coverage
hatch run test-cov

# Generate coverage report
hatch run cov-report

# Generate XML coverage report (for CI/codecov)
hatch run cov-xml

# Generate HTML coverage report
hatch run cov-html

# Run all coverage commands together
hatch run cov

# Run linting with pre-commit
hatch run lint

# Run linting with diff output
hatch run lint-check
```

### Test Environment Matrix
The test environment supports multiple Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11) with additional test dependencies:

```bash
# Run tests on all Python versions
hatch run test:run

# Run tests with coverage on all Python versions
hatch run test:run-cov

# Run tests on specific Python version
hatch run test.py3.9:run
hatch run test.py3.10:run
hatch run test.py3.11:run

# Generate coverage reports in test environment
hatch run test:cov-report
hatch run test:cov-xml
hatch run test:cov-html

# Run full coverage workflow
hatch run test:cov
```

## Common Commands

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests (uses pytest with -n 4 for parallel execution)
hatch run test

# Run specific test file
hatch run test tests/test_health_controller.py

# Run tests with specific options
hatch run test -x -v  # Stop on first failure, verbose output

# Run tests without parallel execution
hatch run test -n 0
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Enter development shell
hatch shell

# Run linting before committing (uses pre-commit)
hatch run lint

# Run tests with coverage and generate reports
hatch run test-cov
hatch run cov-report

# Or run the full coverage workflow
hatch run cov
```

### Environment Management
```bash
# Show available environments
hatch env show

# Remove all environments (clean slate)
hatch env prune

# Create specific environment
hatch env create test.py3.9
hatch env create test.py3.10
hatch env create test.py3.11
```

## Configuration Details

### Default Environment
- **Python Version:** 3.9
- **Extra Dependencies:** psycopg2-binary
- **Scripts:** test, test-cov, cov-report, cov-xml, cov-html, cov, lint, lint-check

### Test Environment
- **Python Versions:** 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 (matrix)
- **Extra Dependencies:** psycopg2-binary, Flask-Testing, coverage[toml], pytest-xdist
- **Scripts:** run, run-cov, cov-report, cov-xml, cov-html, cov

### Test Configuration (pytest)
- **Test Paths:** tests/
- **Parallel Execution:** 4 workers by default (pytest-xdist)
- **Traceback Style:** short

### Coverage Configuration
- **Source:** ibutsu_server
- **Branch Coverage:** Enabled
- **Omit:** tests, __pycache__, migrations
- **XML Output:** coverage.xml
- **HTML Output:** htmlcov/

### Linting Configuration
- **Tool:** pre-commit (runs Ruff and other checks)
- **Ruff Line Length:** 100
- **Enabled Rules:** E, W, F, I, UP, B, C4, N, S, T20, PT, RET, SIM, ARG, PTH, ERA, PL, RUF

## Notes

- The configuration automatically uses `psycopg2-binary` to avoid compilation issues
- All test dependencies are automatically installed when using hatch environments
- The existing `test_env` virtual environment can still be used alongside hatch
- Hatch environments are isolated and don't interfere with your system Python
- Tests run with 4 parallel workers by default for faster execution
- Pre-commit hooks are used for linting (install with `pre-commit install`)
